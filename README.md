# LIRI Bot

Welcome to LIRI Bot! LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI works through the user's command line, and takes in parameters from the user to give back data.

## What does LIRI do?

LIRI Bot has the capability to take in four different commands from the user:

* spotify-this-song "insert song here"
* movie-this "insert movie title here"
* concert-this "insert name of band/singer here"
* do-what-it-says

The user can type in any four of these commands with the desired parameter and LIRI Bot will display the data the user is looking for.
